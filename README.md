# Radio

Useful files for two-way Amateur Radios and GMRS / FRS Walkie-Talkies.

The files BTECH_GMRS-V1_Radio1 and BTECH_GMRS-V1_Radio2 contain the memory channels programmed into my two BTECH GMRS-V1 radios (https://baofengtech.com/gmrs-v1) for use with the CHIRP software (https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home).  

The file Baofeng_UV-82HP.img contains the memory channels of my BaoFeng UV-82HP HAM Radio (https://baofengtech.com/uv-82hp).

These files focus on using the radio in the Santa Cruz / Central Coast / Salinas Valley area in California. 
Be sure to have the correct FCC license before transmitting with any two-radio! (I have both a GMRS and Amateur Radio license)
